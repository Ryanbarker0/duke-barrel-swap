# Duke Barrel Swap

The plugin adds a small quality of life improvement to the Duke Sucellus room. When Musca/Arder mushrooms are in the players inventory, the default option on Fermentation Vats will be swapped to `Check`. When there are no Musca/Arder mushrooms (either it's empty or the player has ground them into Musca/Arder powder) the option will be set to `Fill`. This stops accidentally filling the barrels when the player still has Musca/Arder mushrooms.
